A similar issue is affecting three IMPERIALTOBACCO archives:

For ImperialTobacco TR and ImperialTobacco HU

The new seed is HTTPS, so every time we open a snapshot, it tries to load the HTTPS page, which causes the “Archive Page not Found” message to appear. Manually replacing the URL with HTTP will load the content, but we would need to have an automatic redirect. (just for the migrated snapshots, not for the new snapshots)



ImperialTobacco RU

Is the opposite, it loads first the HTTP but for the migrated snapshots, I would want to load the HTTPS (just for the migrated snapshots, not for the new snapshots)
